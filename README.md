# Collective Analysis

This repo implements the collective analysis of OmniMon individually.
The analysis programe works for results generated by either testbed program or Mininet program.

## Dependencies

Install eigen library: [http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php]

## Prepare input files

Each epoch has a directory of input files for the analysis. These files are generated by switches and end-hosts.

The files include:

- device\_ids.txt: specify the ids of all end-hosts and switches
- path.txt: specify the expected path along which each flow travels
- src\_X: output file of each source end-host whose id is X. This file containing all flows sent from end-host X.
- dst\_X\_Y: output file of each destination end-host. This file includes flow values that are sent from end-host X and received by end-host Y.
- sX.txt: output of switch X.

We provide a simple sample in directory [collective\_analysis/sample].

## Compile and Run

1. Enter collective analysis directory:
```
cd collective_analysis
```

2. Compile
```
make
```

3. Run
```
./main [dir]
```
Here, dir is the input directory.

## Example

In our sample example, some packets of a flow are dropped by Switch 3. The result is:
